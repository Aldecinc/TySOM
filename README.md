# TySOM

TySOM is a family of development boards for embedded applications that features Xilinx® Zynq™ all programmable module combining FPGA with ARM® Cortex processor. Plethora of included peripherals makes these boards useful in various embedded applications like Automotive, IoT, Industrial automation or embedded HPC.

Aldec provides the following list of boards:
-	[TySOM-1](https://www.aldec.com/en/products/emulation/tysom_boards/zynq_7000/tysom_1)
-	[TySOM-1A](https://www.aldec.com/en/products/emulation/tysom_boards/zynq_7000/tysom_1a)
-	[TySOM-2](https://www.aldec.com/en/products/emulation/tysom_boards/zynq_7000/tysom_2)
-	[TySOM-2A](https://www.aldec.com/en/products/emulation/tysom_boards/zynq_7000/tysom_2a)
