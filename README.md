## 1. SDx-platforms

A collection of configuration platforms for Xilinx SDx tool that help customers use Aldec TySOM board with SDx to accelerate algorithms in Zynq FPGA chip.

> Note: Provided SDx platfors use Chroma Resampler and On-Screen Display IP cores from LogicCORE. This is why additional licenses are required.
